**Understanding and Applying Node.js**

**Core Concepts:**

* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
* **Modules:** Reusable blocks of code that can be imported into other parts of your application.
* **HTTP Server:** A program that listens for incoming network requests and responds to them.
* **Command-Line Arguments:** Data passed to a Node.js script when it's executed from the command line.
* **Environment Variables:** Configuration settings that can be accessed within a Node.js application.

**Key Skills:**

1. **Running JavaScript with Node.js:**
   - Use the `node` command in your terminal to execute JavaScript files.
   - Understand the Node.js event loop and asynchronous programming.
2. **Using Node.js Modules:**
   - Import modules using the `require()` function.
   - Use built-in modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`, and `os`.
   - Install external modules using npm (Node Package Manager).
3. **Reading Files with Node.js:**
   - Use the `fs` module to read files synchronously or asynchronously.
   - Handle file encoding and error handling.
4. **Accessing Command-Line Arguments and Environment Variables:**
   - Use the `process.argv` array to access command-line arguments.
   - Use the `process.env` object to access environment variables.
5. **Creating an HTTP Server with Node.js:**
   - Use the `http` module to create a basic HTTP server.
   - Handle incoming requests and send responses.
   - Implement routing and request handling.
6. **Creating an HTTP Server with Express.js:**
   - Use the Express.js framework to simplify server-side web development.
   - Define routes and handle requests using middleware functions.
   - Use Express.js features like routing, templating, and static file serving.
7. **Advanced Routing with Express.js:**
   - Use route parameters to dynamically match URLs.
   - Use middleware functions to perform actions before or after route handlers.
   - Handle HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
8. **Using ES6 with Node.js:**
   - Use modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, classes, modules, and destructuring.
   - Use a tool like Babel to transpile ES6 code to ES5 for compatibility with older Node.js versions.
9. **Using Nodemon for Faster Development:**
   - Install Nodemon as a development dependency.
   - Run Nodemon to automatically restart your server when file changes are detected.

By mastering these concepts and skills, you'll be able to build robust and efficient Node.js applications.
